# Nintendo 64: USB-C Kit

The **Nintendo 64: USB-C Kit** is a board that allows to replace the original power supply unit for a modern and standard USB-C.

**If your original power supply unit is too old or damaged** and you need a new one, or **if you would like to power up your Nintendo 64 with a standard USB-C PD charger**, such as the charger for your phone, or laptop, you can do so with this kit.

## HOW DOES IT WORK?

The **USB-C Power Delivery technology (USB-C PD)** allows for communication between the device and the charger, enabling the negotiation of the voltage to be supplied through the USB-C cable. In this case, the microchip included in this board is configured to request 12V, signaling to the charger that it requires 12V to operate. If the charger is compatible, it will supply the requested voltage. If it’s not compatible, nothing will happen, and the Nintendo 64 won’t be able to power on.

Since the console also needs 3.3V in addition to 12V, the kit includes a buck converter to provide it, ensuring that all electrical functions are covered by the kit.
